    <h2>Born journey</h2>
    <p>(born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal
    and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief 
    executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk acquired Twitter in 2022.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age
    12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because 
    he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available 
    in the United States.</p><br>

    <h2>PayPal and SpaceX</h2>
    <p>Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where 
    he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California,
    but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he 
    founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer 
    Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in 
    transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p><br><br>
    <p>Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the great 
    expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets 
    were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than 
    competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly 
    twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the 
    Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) 
    to low Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building 
    bases on the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon can
    carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test 
    flights of the Super Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon 
    rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2025 as part of NASA’s Artemis 
    space program.</p><br><br>

    <h2>Tesla</h2>
    <p>Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), 
    an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel
    245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that
    could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two years 
    later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its 
    Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric 
    car of all time.</p>
